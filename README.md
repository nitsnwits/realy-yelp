Contextual recommendation system: 
We have built a web application which provides recommendation to user based on his past records. Real time contextual information has been added such as time stamp, latitude and longitude and budget. The recommendation are provided for categories such as restaurants, bars and pubs, books stores and shopping. 
We have used python for backend data mining processing as python is more suitable. We have used Pandas data analytics library for the task. MRJob is used for which provides map – reduce paradigm abstraction in python for scaling the algorithm. Apache spark was also used for distributed parallel processing in preprocessing step (as explained in the report). 
On the front end bootstrap and phantom js is used for better responsiveness. Tableau and d3Js was used for visualization of analytics of the data. 
For running the project you will need below dependencies set up: 
1) Python 2.7 
2) Pandas and MrJob library from python
3) Apache Spark  
4) MongoDb Server
5) Node.js 

Project structure: 
We are following MVC architecture for our web application. All the files related to backend processing is in lib folder. Other than that have followed standard convention for bin, config, and controllers, model and views folder.
