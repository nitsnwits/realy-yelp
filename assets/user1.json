I figure there should be no problem getting some food and being out of there in time to pick my girlfriend up from yoga at 8pm. The line is moving at a snails pace and 10 minutes in I'm starting to worry. I really want to try this famed fried catfish I've read in these reviews. Around 20 minutes in I finally get to place my order for some catfish and fried okra (it's been forever since I've had some and I love it). I end up waiting a total time of nearly an hour and give up on the okra because somehow that was forgotten from my huge order of... two items. So I figured I'll just grab some macaroni salad that they had pre made and head out since I was supposed to pick my girlfriend up nearly half an hour ago.\n\nSo we finally sit down to eat the food I brought back hoping that it makes up for the wait. I figure it might have been an off night, but if the food's tasty I'm willing to give it a pass. No such luck! The catfish is terrible. It's most definitely frozen catfish that they have tried to mask the flavor and texture of with the breading to no avail. The macaroni salad tastes like they thought it was supposed to be a dessert, so they piled on the sugar.", "type": "review", "business_id": "b6qYCOz0vzJW4U81XLY8IA"}

Much to my surprise a place called Mint Indian Bistro showed up. After reading the reviews it seemed like the place had a mix of Himalayan and Northern Indian cuisine. So we made a resolution, we'll try some appetizers and if we didn't like it we would go to a different restaurant for our main meal.\n\nAll that plan B contingency stuff went out the window when I looked at the menu. They actually had menu items marked as vegan and vegetarian such that for once I would not have to ask about the ingredients they use in each of the dishes. So we made the plunge. We decided to share the Vegan Sampler and it was good. I want to say it was great, but there were a couple of items in the sampler that I did not enjoy as much as the rest.\n\nAdditionally the decor and feel of the restaurant was very nice. They even turned the lights up for us temporarily while we were perusing the menu so my mother could see the menus as she squinted without her reading glasses again.\n\nWith full disclosure and all that jazz I would say the food was in the four star range, but the addition of the vegan friendly menu really pushes the rating up for me into the five star range.

When we first sat down, there were some pine needles and a bit of debris on the table. They cleaned it off and I did not think much of it, until later when we discovered why they were on the table. We were sitting under a pine tree, and when the wind blew it was dropping bits and pieces on the table! The waiter feigned ignorance as if he had never seen that happen before, but it detracted from an otherwise stellar meal.\n\nSo we took our time in deciding which of the three available courses we wanted. There was a prix fixe menu that my girlfriend ended up choosing and the degustation menu I decided on. I mentioned that I was pescatarian and the waiter said it was no problem making substitutions as need be, so I ended up substituting the foie gras dish for a shrimp dish from the prix fixe menu. I also decided to do the wine pairing for the degustation menu.\n\nI have to say that all the food I had was exquisite. Each course had a wide variety of flavors, that blended together so well that I felt my palate was going on a ride.

Well fresh air mixed with smoke would have to do.\n\nSo a minute or two later, the waitress comes up and gives me the menu to look at and takes my drink order. When she comes back I immediately order an appetizer, the baba ganoush. She seems totally clueless as to what I just ordered and nearly yanks the menu out of my hands so she can take it with her because she needs it to remember the order. I know, WTF?\n\nThe baba ganoush comes nearly immediately. My guess is that they have it premade and just slap it on a dish and go. I tell the waitress that I need a minute to decide for my entree. It turns out that I need a minute equates to don't come and check on me for literally 20 minutes! In fact I don't see the waitress again until after my order comes back, so instead I end up flagging down the bus boy who luckily came out to clean up the table of the only other group that was out on the patio. \n\nI ask him to get the waitress, but he insists that he can take my order, in very broken English I can barely understand. I tell him my order and he is sounds confused. So I point to the two items on the menu. The guy still seems a little clueless, but walks off repeating the order to himself, only to return moments later. He has a pen, highlights menu items I ordered, and takes the menu with him. At this point I'm really unsure if I'll even be getting what I ordered if neither the waitress nor the bus boy can remember very simplistic orders.\n\nAfter all is said and done, the food was not very appetizing. I ate little but the baba ganoush (which was decent) and I ended up taking the okra home. I told the waitress not to box the soup that I hardly touched. So she asks, \"Didn't you like it?\" At that point I was kind of dumbfounded. Why else would I ask NOT to take it home. It was that atrocious. Do I have to spell it out?\n\nNow that I see the other reviews I don't feel so horrible giving this place one star. It seems there is a consensus on this place. I really need to get an iPhone already so I can check reviews before I make these bad dining decisions.", "type": "review", "business_id": "u0cuE27NIdXAil6i-scRGw"}

The food was definitely more than my mother and I could finish and it was all very tasty. From my visits to other Ethiopian places in Vegas like Axum, I can say this was definitely the best tasting Ethiopian food I have had in the area.\n\nAdditionally the wait staff was very friendly. When we came in we were the only people in the restaurant and they treated us very well. They patiently described all the dishes that my mother asked about and made us feel very welcome. In fact later on in the evening during our coffee ceremony some of the wait staff's family came in with some homemade bread they had made. They cut some of it up and offered it to us as well.\n\nThis would have been a five star review, but the ambience just wasn't there.

Despite getting regular size fries, the girl dishing out the fries scooped up an extra bit and tossed it in the bag as well. That's about as far as the compliments go in this review.\n\nI really wish I had anything positive to say about the sandwich, but it was pretty terrible all around. The cheese was soft and gooey like a nacho cheese, but lacking in any flavor. In fact 20 minutes later after the cheese had cooled off the cheese was exactly the same consistency. If they use the same cheese for the cheeseburgers, then I can't imagine anyone giving this place high marks.

Initially I had a bit of a tough time finding the place, as there was no hint as to where this was from the Yelp reviews. Turns out it is in the Venetian casino area. It's new enough that when I asked someone who worked at the Venetian where it was he said: \"I don't know. Is it new?\"\n\nI ordered take out from the bar as I was grabbing something to go to eat with my girlfriend. I was not too big of a fan of the atmosphere of the restaurant, luckily I was getting food to go. I ended up ordering a veggie burger, an ahi tuna burger, fried pickles, and pickled beets. All told around $50. While I was waiting for the food, I figured I would grab a beer. It took me a bit to decide what I wanted, and when I finally decided it turns out that the beer was nearly tapped out so there wasn't a full glass to be had. While the bartender went to look to see if the keg could be swapped, the food came. I was surprised at just how quickly the food came. So in the end, I got to taste the beer, but did not actually sit and drink a beer. Oh well, maybe next time.\n\nNow onto the food! My girlfriend and I ended up sharing the burgers. The veggie burger seemed like typical fare to me, having previously been a long time vegan, though when my girlfriend tried it she exclaimed \"I don't think this is a veggie burger.\" So it apparently does a decent enough job of masking that it is a veggie burger for some folks.\n\nThe veggie burger was topped with guacamole and was pretty good. I thought the burger itself was a little over done, but overall yummy. The ahi tuna burger, was tasty as well, but my girlfriend and I both agreed that the veggie burger was still a little better.\n\nNow for the pickled delights! This is the first time I've had fried pickles before, and I have to say I really liked them! It's definitely worth a try. If you've had pickled beets before, well these will taste pretty familiar. Overall, I liked the pickled fare as a nice compliment to the burgers, though I really like pickled stuff.\n\nOverall it was nice.
